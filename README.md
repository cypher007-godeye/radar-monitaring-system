Radar-Based Obstacle Detection System

This project demonstrates a radar-style obstacle detection system using an ESP32-DEVKIT-V1, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. The system scans the environment in a 180° range, detects objects, and visualizes the data in real-time using a Java (Processing) interface.

Features:

Real-time distance measurement using the ultrasonic sensor

Servo-controlled scanning for 180° range

Live radar display in Processing to visualize obstacle data

Serial communication between ESP32 and PC


Technologies:

Hardware: ESP32, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor

Software: Embedded C, Processing (Java), Serial Communication


Installation:

1. Upload the firmware to the ESP32.


2. Open the Processing sketch and run the visualization.
