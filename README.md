Radar-Based Obstacle Detection and Visualization System
Personal Embedded Systems 

Designed and implemented a radar-style obstacle detection system leveraging an ESP32-DEVKIT-V1, ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04), and servo motor, with a real-time graphical interface built in Processing (Java). The system performs automated environmental scanning across 180Â°, detecting and visualizing nearby objects on a radar-like display.

Project Highlights:

Engineered precise servo control for angular scanning and object localization

Integrated ultrasonic sensing for accurate distance measurement

Developed a serial communication protocol between the ESP32 and PC

Built an interactive radar interface in Processing to visualize spatial data in real time

Demonstrated applications in robotics, automation, and smart surveillance systems


Technologies Used:
ESP32, HC-SR04, Servo Motor, Embedded C/C++, Java (Processing IDE), Serial Communication
